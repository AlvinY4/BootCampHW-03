# Alvin Yearby JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator 
For this challenge I created a password generator, that create the user a custom password containing lowercase, uppercase letters, and special characters based on the users choice. The user also gets to choose how long their will be, but cannot be below 8 or above 128 characters. I achived this by using the JavaScript knowledge that we learned in class, the modules and my tutor.
